# PlotCraft
A tool for creating Minecraft layouts

I got tired of using programs that weren't designed for it to draw out plans for areas in Minecraft; and all the tools I managed to find to do it were slow, buggy, unintuitive, or otherwise unpleasant to use. So I decided to use my vacation time to put together my own tool. You are welcome to use it, modify it, and improve it. I'll keep plinking away at it as I have time, I'm sure. Lots of ideas for this one. But for now, it's at least an editor that can save, load, draw, that responds quickly and doesn't seem to blow my RAM budget or choke up on large plots. ;)

## Notes ##

### IntelliJ IDEA ###

The priject is currently just the IntelliJ IDEA project I used to make it. I am aware that I should probably migrate the code base over to using a universal command-line tool like Ant, I just don't feel like doing that yet. But hey, it's on GitHub, so consider that a task you are welcome to get to before I do. ;)

### Textures ###

The current settings.json file assumes that there is a "textures/blocks" directory located next to the jar and settings.json files. This is where it is looking for the tile images (specified in settings.json). I will not include the textures from Minecraft without permission, so if you want them, you should get them yourself. It's not that difficult, since you probably already have a copy of Minecraft.

Instructions for copying your Minecraft textures directory:
